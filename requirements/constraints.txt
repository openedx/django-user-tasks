# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# pyyaml==6.0 made the `Loader` a necessary argument for `yaml.load()` function.
# swagger2rst uses pyyaml and fails with the new version hence failing the `make docs` command.
# This constraint can be removed once the https://github.com/Arello-Mobile/swagger2rst/issues/10 is done.
