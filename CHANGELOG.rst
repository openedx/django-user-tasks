[0.1.4] - 2017-01-30

* Slightly improved handling of tasks which start before their status records
  are committed (due to database transactions).  Also documented how to avoid
  this problem in the first place.

[0.1.3] - 2017-01-03
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changed
+++++++

* Tasks which were explicitly canceled, failed, or retried no longer have
  their status changed to ``Succeeded`` just because the task exited cleanly.
* Celery tasks which fail to import cleanly by name (because they use a custom
  name which isn't actually the fully qualified task name) are now just ignored
  in the ``before_task_publish`` signal handler.

[0.1.2] - 2016-12-05
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changed
+++++++

* Add a migration to explicitly reference the setting for artifact file storage.
  This setting is likely to vary between installations, but doesn't affect the
  generated database schema.  This change should prevent ``makemigrations``
  from creating a new migration whenever the setting value changes.
